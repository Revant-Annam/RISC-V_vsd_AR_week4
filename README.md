# Week 4: CMOS Circuit Design (sky130-style) 

Welcome to this repository detailing the fundamental characterization of CMOS circuits, using the workhorse of digital logic‚Äîthe inverter‚Äîas our case study. This project bridges the critical gap between semiconductor device physics and circuit-level performance metrics.

All simulations are performed using the open-source **`ngspice`** circuit simulator and the **Google/SkyWater `sky130`** open-source Process Design Kit (PDK).

## üéØ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a transistor-level understanding of a CMOS inverter by performing a series of fundamental analyses. We explore everything from the basic current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of individual MOSFETs to the dynamic switching behavior and operational robustness of the complete inverter gate.

This repository is structured into two main parts:
* **`/Theory`**: Contains daily markdown files that explain the theoretical concepts behind each analysis.
* **`/Tasks`**: Contains the practical `ngspice` netlists and simulation results for each analysis described in the theory section.

## üî¨ Analysis Breakdown: From Transistor to Gate

This project is broken down into five core modules, each with a theoretical and practical component.

| Day / Topic | Theoretical Focus (`/Theory`) | Practical Simulation (`/Tasks`) | Key Insights |

## üöÄ How to Run the Simulations

To replicate the results found in the `/Tasks` directory, you need `ngspice` installed.

1.  Navigate to one of the task directories.
2.  Run the simulation using the following command:
    ```bash
    ngspice <name_of_netlist_file>.spice
    ```
3.  The simulation will run, and if you are in interactive mode, you can use `ngspice` commands like `plot` or `display` to view the results. The `.meas` commands within the files will automatically calculate key parameters.

## üìú Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive logbook for understanding CMOS technology from the ground up. By characterizing these fundamental properties, we establish the foundation for designing complex digital systems and performing critical verification tasks like **Static Timing Analysis (STA)**, where metrics like propagation delay and noise margins are paramount.
