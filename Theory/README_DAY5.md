### Static behaviour evaluation — CMOS inverter robustness — Power supply variation

#### Overview
Scaling the power supply voltage directly influences the static characteristics of a CMOS inverter. This affects its switching threshold ($V_m$), noise margins, and overall resilience to interference.

#### SPICE Simulation
A simulation of the CMOS inverter is performed using two different supply voltages, scaling **Vdd** down from **2.5V** to **1V**. The dimensions of the transistors are kept constant throughout the simulation, with the PMOS width ($W_p$) at 0.9375 μm and the NMOS width ($W_n$) at 0.375 μm.

* ✅ **Switching Threshold ($V_m$)**: As the supply voltage **Vdd** is reduced, the inverter's switching threshold, $V_m$, tends to shift closer to the middle of the voltage range. However, this shift comes with the trade-off of shrinking noise margins.

* ✅ **Noise Margins**: A lower **Vdd** leads to reduced noise immunity. This makes the circuit more susceptible to noise and fluctuations in the power supply.

* ✅ **Performance Impact**: While operating at a low **Vdd** is effective for reducing both static and dynamic power consumption, it compromises the circuit's noise robustness. In contrast, a higher **Vdd** enhances the noise margin but results in increased power dissipation. Consequently, power scaling is a crucial aspect of low-power design that demands a careful balance between noise margin and circuit reliability.

The accompanying plot shows how the **Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC)** of the inverter change with different power supply levels. It clearly demonstrates a progressive decrease in noise margins as **Vdd** is lowered.

* **Advantages of using 0.5V supply**: Operating at a lower **Vdd**, such as 0.5V, offers substantial benefits like an approximate **50% improvement in gain** and a **90% reduction in energy consumption**. This highlights the efficiency of scaling the power supply for CMOS inverters.

* **Disadvantage of using 0.5V supply**: Although lowering **Vdd** enhances gain and energy efficiency, it can negatively impact performance. With reduced drive strength, the circuits may switch at a slower rate.

### Static behaviour evaluation-CMOS inverter robustness-Device variation

#### Device Variation and CMOS Inverter Robustness
Device variation is a critical factor that determines the robustness of a CMOS inverter. These variations primarily stem from two sources during fabrication:
* Etching Variation
* Oxide Thickness Variation

#### Etching Variation
**Etching** is a fundamental step in the manufacturing of semiconductors that defines the physical dimensions of the CMOS layout, such as the **Width (W)** and **Length (L)** of transistors. During fabrication, slight differences often arise between the designed dimensions and the final physical structures.

* The **P-diffusion region** sets the width of the PMOS gate.
* The **N-diffusion region** sets the width of the NMOS gate.
* The **Poly-silicon layer thickness** determines the gate length (L), which typically corresponds to the technology node (e.g., 20nm, 45nm).

Etching also impacts other layout features, including metal layers and the contacts between them.

#### Impact on Device Performance
The final fabricated **W** and **L** of transistors often deviate from their ideal design values. Since the drain current ($I_d$) is dependent on both **W** and **L**, any variations from etching directly influence the transistor's current. This, in turn, causes variations in the CMOS inverter's:
* Switching Threshold ($V_m$)
* Noise Margins
* Overall robustness and performance

The first image contrasts the ideal design mask with the actual fabricated structure, illustrating how **etching variation** occurs. Limitations in the manufacturing process cause these variations in **W** and **L**, which affect the device's performance and current drive capability.

The second image shows an **inverter chain**, which is a series of interconnected CMOS inverters. The layout at the bottom displays the physical structure of each inverter, indicating key layers such as Poly (Gate), P-Diffusion, N-Diffusion, VDD, and VSS. These chains are frequently used to analyze **delay, robustness, and process variations** across several logic stages.

#### Oxide Thickness Variation
During MOSFET manufacturing, the actual gate **oxide thickness** often differs from the ideal, intended thickness. Since the drain current ($I_d$) is dependent on the oxide capacitance ($C_{ox}$), any variation in the oxide's thickness directly affects $I_d$, thereby influencing the CMOS inverter's performance.

The image provided illustrates the discrepancy between the **ideal** and **actual** oxide thickness that can occur during fabrication.

These two primary sources of deviation—**etching variation** (affecting W and L) and **oxide thickness variation**—are crucial in determining the overall robustness of CMOS inverters. We will now explore the effects of sweeping the PMOS and NMOS widths.

### Transistor Strength Definitions:

* **Strong PMOS**: A PMOS transistor with low resistance, which allows it to charge the output capacitor more quickly. This is achieved by designing the PMOS with a **wider** gate.
* **Weak NMOS**: An NMOS transistor with higher resistance. Since resistance is inversely proportional to the device's area, this is achieved by making the NMOS **narrower**.
* **Weak PMOS**: A PMOS transistor with higher resistance, created by designing it with a **narrower** gate.
* **Strong NMOS**: An NMOS transistor that features low resistance. This is accomplished by fabricating it with a **wider** gate.
